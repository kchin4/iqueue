# iqueue
Final Project for CPE322

My mother has always hated the line for returning items at clothing stores,
so I wanted to create a solution. If this was a real app, customers could give
their name and phone number to the worker or text to an SMS short code, then walk
away from the line, rather than stand and wait. When the customer is next
in line, they would receive a text notification and arrive by the time the
current customer is done being serviced. This is essentially a restaurant
pager system, but for clothing store lines. It has the potential to be used
for many other applications as well.

The way this would work is by the user giving their name and phone number
to a worker at the establishment or texting an SMS short code. The user
would then be entered into the queue and be notified when it's close to their turn.
The worker would have the ability to add more entries as needed, search entries,
display the queue, display estimated wait time, delete entries, move the queue forward,
and clear the queue.

In the future, the user would be able to access features such as
displaying the estimated wait time or deleting their own entry. The worker operating
the queue could also change the wait time estimater depending on the average service
time. Ideally, the user would not have to download the app on their phone and only the
establishment would need it. That way, the user can simply text a short code and
access all the necessary features. This could also be implemented in the form
of a website, allowing users to choose between using wifi/data or text.

Since this project is being made around the time of Covid-19, it could even be applied
to waiting lines for groceries, hospital tests, or many other related uses.
