Final Project for CPE322

My mother has always hated the line for returning items at clothing stores,
so I wanted to create a solution. If this was a real app, customers could give
their name and phone number (or, ideally, text to an SMS short code), then walk
away from the line, rather than stand and wait. When the customer is next
in line, they would receive a text notification and arrive by the time the
current customer is done being serviced. This is essentially a restaurant
pager system, but for clothing store lines. It has the potential to be used
for many other applications as well.
